# Chess Game with Piece Ability System - TODO List

## Project Overview
A web-based multiplayer chess game where pieces can gain abilities by capturing other pieces. When a piece captures another piece, it gains the movement abilities of the captured piece while retaining its own abilities. Features real-time gameplay via WebSocket with lobby system for 2-player matches.

- [ ] Implement undo/redo functionality
- [ ] Create save/load game system
- [ ] Add game statistics
- [ ] Implement AI opponent (optional)

## WebSocket Message Protocol

### 18. Message Types
- [ ] **Lobby Messages**:
  - `create_lobby` - Create new lobby with settings
  - `join_lobby` - Join existing lobby with code
  - `leave_lobby` - Leave current lobby
  - `lobby_update` - Broadcast lobby state changes
  - `start_game` - Owner starts the game
- [ ] **Game Messages**:
  - `move_piece` - Player makes a move
  - `game_state` - Broadcast current game state
  - `game_over` - Game end notification
  - `promotion_choice` - Pawn promotion selection
- [ ] **System Messages**:
  - `connection_status` - Connection health
  - `error` - Error notifications
  - `ping/pong` - Keep-alive messages

## Technical Considerations

### Data Structures

- [ ] Create reusable movement validation
- [ ] Design extensible ability system

## Priority Levels
- **High Priority**: WebSocket server setup, lobby system, basic chess implementation, piece ability system
- **Medium Priority**: Frontend UI, real-time communication, movement validation, game state management
- **Low Priority**: Polish features, advanced settings, additional game modes

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Set up Python WebSocket server
- Create basic lobby system
- Implement simple chess board and piece movement
- Basic frontend with lobby creation/joining

### Phase 2: Core Game (Weeks 3-4)
- Implement piece ability system
- Add capture and ability transfer mechanics
- Create real-time game communication
- Basic game UI with board and pieces

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-6)
- Pawn promotion with abilities
- Complex movement validation
- Game state management and synchronization
- Polish UI and user experience

### Phase 4: Testing & Polish (Week 7+)
- Comprehensive testing
- Bug fixes and optimization
- Additional features and polish

## Notes
- Focus on core mechanics first (ability inheritance)
- Ensure the ability system is flexible and extensible
- Consider the complexity of pieces with multiple movement types
- Plan for edge cases in ability combinations
- Keep the codebase clean and maintainable for future enhancements
- **WebSocket Considerations**: Handle connection drops, implement reconnection logic
- **Lobby System**: Generate unique codes, handle concurrent lobby creation
- **Owner Controls**: Only lobby creator can start game and modify settings
- **Real-time Sync**: Ensure both players see identical game state
- **Security**: Validate moves on server side, prevent cheating
