# Game Ending Features Implementation

## Overview
Added comprehe### 1. Timeout Detection Flow
```
Timer Manager (every 100ms) → Check all games → Time expired? → Auto game_over → Broadcast to players
```

### 2. Resignation Flowgame ending mechanics to the absorb chess game, including timeout detection, resignation, and draw offers/acceptance.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Main Server Routing (`server/server.py`)
Added message routing for new game ending events:
- `resign` → routes to `game_handler.handle_resign()`
- `timeout` → routes to `game_handler.handle_timeout()`
- `offer_draw` → routes to `game_handler.handle_offer_draw()`
- `accept_draw` → routes to `game_handler.handle_accept_draw()`
- `decline_draw` → routes to `game_handler.handle_decline_draw()`
- `promotion_choice` → routes to `game_handler.handle_promotion_choice()`

All handlers broadcast responses to all players in the lobby.

### 2. Game Handler (`server/handlers/game_handler.py`)
Added comprehensive game ending functionality:

#### Timeout Detection
- **Automatic Timer System**: Independent timer manager checks for timeouts every 100ms
- **Immediate Detection**: Game ends immediately when time runs out, not when move is attempted
- **`TimerManager`**: Dedicated class that monitors all active games for timeouts
- **Broadcast System**: Automatically sends `game_over` message to all players when timeout occurs

#### Resignation
- **`handle_resign()`**: Allows players to resign, declaring opponent as winner
- Sets `game_over=True` and determines winner as opposite color

#### Draw System
- **`handle_offer_draw()`**: Rate-limited draw offers (max 3 per minute per player)
- **`handle_accept_draw()`**: Accepts draw offer, ends game with no winner
- **`handle_decline_draw()`**: Declines draw offer, notifies offering player
- Uses `draw_offer_history` to track rate limiting per player

#### Promotion Handling
- **`handle_promotion_choice()`**: Handles promotion piece selection
- Supports queen, rook, bishop, knight promotion
- Includes promotion cancellation if allowed

### 3. Search Handler (`server/handlers/search_handler.py`)
- **Updated `handle_cancel_search()`**: Now sends `search_game_cancelled` message type
- Properly removes player from searching list
- Frontend receives correct message type for state reset

## Frontend Features (Already Implemented)

### Game Controls
- **Resign Button**: Sends `resign` message with confirmation dialog
- **Offer Draw Button**: Sends `offer_draw` message
- **Leave Game**: Also triggers resignation

### Draw Offer Modal
- Appears when opponent offers a draw
- **Accept**: Sends `accept_draw` message
- **Decline**: Sends `decline_draw` message with opponent ID

### Message Handling
- `game_over`: Updates game state and shows game over screen
- `draw_offered`: Shows draw offer modal to opponent
- `draw_declined`: Shows toast notification
- `draw_offer_rate_limited`: Shows rate limit warning
- `search_game_cancelled`: Resets search state to main menu

## Game Flow

### 1. Timeout Detection
```
Player's turn → Check clock → If time ≤ 0 → handle_timeout() → game_over
```

### 2. Resignation Flow
```
Resign button → Confirmation → resign message → handle_resign() → game_over
```

### 3. Draw Offer Flow
```
Offer Draw → offer_draw message → Rate limit check → Draw modal to opponent
Opponent Accept → accept_draw message → game_over (no winner)
Opponent Decline → decline_draw message → Toast notification
```

### 4. Search Cancellation
```
Cancel Search → cancel_search message → Remove from queue → search_game_cancelled → Main menu
```

## Key Features

### Automatic Timeout System
- **Independent Timer**: Runs separately from game moves, checking every 100ms
- **Immediate Response**: Game ends the moment time runs out, not when player tries to move
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors all active games simultaneously
- **Precise Timing**: Uses high-frequency checks (100ms) for responsive timeout detection

### Rate Limiting
- Draw offers limited to 3 per minute per player
- Prevents draw offer spam
- Shows retry timer when limit exceeded

### Timeout Checking
- Checked before every move attempt
- Immediate game ending when time runs out
- No grace period - enforces strict time control

### State Management
- All game ending events update `lobby.game_state`
- Proper winner determination
- Game over flag prevents further moves

### Frontend Integration
- Existing UI elements already connected
- Message handlers already implemented
- Smooth integration with current game flow

## Testing
The implementation is ready for testing:
1. Start server: `python server.py`
2. Open game in browser
3. Test resign, draw offers, and search cancellation
4. Verify timeout detection during gameplay

## Recent Fixes

### Player Name Display Issues
- **Fixed Missing Names**: Search games now properly include `lobby_data` with player names in `game_started` messages
- **Lobby Handler**: Updated `start_game` method to include full lobby data (players, settings, lobby code)
- **Frontend Integration**: Enhanced `handleGameStarted` to use lobby data or fallback to game state for player names
- **Search Results**: `handleGameFound` now properly stores lobby and player information

### Search Cancel Button Issues  
- **Pre-Search Cancel**: Cancel button now works before search starts (returns to main menu)
- **During Search Cancel**: Cancel button during search properly cancels search and returns to main menu
- **Button Logic**: Separated cancel behavior for different search states

### Backend Improvements
- **Message Handling**: Fixed `start_game` method to handle internal messaging correctly
- **Search Handler**: Updated automatic game start after match found
- **Server Routing**: Cleaned up message routing for game start events
